    <p> Hello! My name is Cameron Kucin, and I am currently a freshman at North Carolina State University with an
	intended <strong>Computer Science</strong> major. What got me interested in computer science was a senior project I did for my
	<ins>advanced game art & design</ins> class in high school. The class was divided into several small teams that would
	each go on to create their own unique, original, and playable games in Unity using the skills we had learned up to
	that point. On my team, I ended up being the one working inside the Unity game engine the most, assembling environments
	together, creating interfaces, and doing the majority of the project's <em>programming</em>. It was this programming role that
	really sparked my interest in coding, despite not having the easiest of starts in C#.</p>

	<p style = "font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; text-align: left;"> Despite having worked on a team developed game in the past in addition to <strong>currently leading</strong> the development of a
	second project, I don't know if working in the game industry would be my <em>dream</em> job. Sure, I enjoy doing it and getting
	to be a part of the development process, but given how <ins>competitive</ins> the industry is as well as how intense <ins>time crunches</ins> are
	in real game development settings, I'm just not sure if that sort of workplace is one that I'd want to be a part of in the
	long-term. I'm still interested in learning more <strong>programming languages</strong>, and I'm also open to going into fields related
	to <ins>nuclear fusion</ins> and <ins>brain anatomy</ins>. However, I think it's <em>far</em> too early for me to decide on a dream career path. </p>
